A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary result set that you can reference within a 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs are defined using the WITH keyword, 
and they can make complex queries easier to write, understand, and maintain by breaking them into simpler parts.
